    "# Analysis Pipeline for Pre and Post Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The following analysis pipeline is created to require very little user-input, to make the analyses are straightforward and quick to run as possible. It also ensures the outputs are consistent across all datasets including the 2023 pilot study. However, there are some parameters that are essential to tweak, such as the root path to where you have stored your data, and the selection of the participants and retreats you interested in analysing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **metrics included in this pipeline** are currently restricted to the metrics most important for our research question:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Absolute Power Band** (decrease in alpha with eyes open for PTSD, though results generally mixed for this)\n",
    "* **Peak Alpha Frequency** (Global peak power correlates with PTSD symptoms)\n",
    "* **Signal Diversity (Lempel Ziv complexity)**\n",
    "* **Source and sensory level connectivity**\n",
    "* **Network Based Connectivity** (reduced functional connectivity, lower node degree in PTSD), specifically DMN (PTSD reduced connectivity)\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, it additionally contained:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Frontal and/or Parietal EEG asymmetry (greater right than left parietal asymmetry in alpha band power)\n",
    "* Peak Alpha Frequency (Global peak power correlates with PTSD symptoms)\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be found in an older version of this script. We also aim for this pipeline to be extended to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Oscillations vs. Fractal Power**\n",
    "* **Microstates in the DMN**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These should all be computed within subject pre and post; and also cross-subjects pre and post for significance testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most methods for computing analyses are contained within 'metrics.ipynb' - it is vital that you execute the cell with %run metrics.ipynb, to import these methods.\n"

    "## Calculating Connectivity in Source Space\n",
    "\n",
    "This code is designed to compute and visualize connectivity in source space using EEG data and various neuroimaging techniques. The analysis primarily focuses on functional connectivity, which measures the statistical associations between different brain regions. Here's an overview of the key steps involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing:** EEG data from pre and post conditions is loaded and preprocessed. This includes aligning the data with the subject's anatomy, estimating the forward model, and calculating the inverse operator for source localization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Label Reordering:** Labels representing different brain regions are reordered based on their spatial location in the left hemisphere. This is done to facilitate the visualization of connectivity patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connectivity Computation:** The code computes connectivity measures, specifically using the 'wPLI2_debiased' method, which assesses phase-based functional connectivity. The connectivity is calculated within specific frequency bands defined by 'band_def'.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Group-Level Analysis:** Connectivity measures are computed for each subject separately and then aggregated for group-level analysis. This provides an insight into how connectivity patterns change between pre and post conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Connectivity Visualization:** The code generates connectivity plots in the form of circular connectivity graphs, allowing for visual inspection of changes in connectivity patterns. This is done for each frequency band and each label representing a brain region.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Statistical Analysis (Optional):** If uncommented, the code also includes statistical analysis to assess the significance of changes in connectivity between pre and post conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Plotting and Output:** The resulting connectivity plots are saved as images, and optional titles and subtitles are added for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, this code pipeline takes raw EEG data, processes it, computes source-based connectivity, and provides visual and optional statistical insights into the functional connectivity patterns within the brain. The analysis is performed across different frequency bands and brain regions, providing a comprehensive understanding of how connectivity changes in source space under different experimental conditions."
